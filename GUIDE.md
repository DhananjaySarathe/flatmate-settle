## Understanding Split Spaces

**Split Spaces** are like separate groups or projects where you can organize different sets of expenses. Think of them as different "rooms" or "contexts" for your expense tracking.

### Why Use Split Spaces?

- **Apartment Expenses**: Track rent, utilities, groceries for your apartment
- **Vacation Trips**: Keep travel expenses separate from daily living costs
- **Office Expenses**: Manage shared office costs with colleagues
- **Events**: Track expenses for parties, dinners, or special occasions

### Working with Split Spaces

#### Creating a New Split Space

1. Navigate to **Split Spaces** from the top navigation
2. Click **"Create SplitSpace"** button
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Summer Vacation 2024", "Office Team Lunch")
4. Click **"Create"**

#### Selecting a Split Space

- Use the **SplitSpace selector** at the top of the page (next to your name)
- Click on any Split Space to make it active
- All your actions (adding flatmates, expenses) will be scoped to the selected Split Space

#### Editing a Split Space

- Click the **"Edit"** button on any Split Space card
- Change the name and save

#### Deleting a Split Space

- Click the **"Delete"** button on a Split Space card
- **Note**: You can only delete Split Spaces that:
  - Are not named "Default" (the default space cannot be deleted)
  - Have no flatmates or expenses (you must remove them first)

## Managing Flatmates

**Flatmates** are the people you're splitting expenses with. They can be your actual flatmates, friends, family members, or anyone sharing costs with you.

### Adding a Flatmate

1. Go to the **Dashboard** page
2. Click **"Add Flatmate"** button
3. Fill in the information:
   - **Name** (required): The person's name
   - **Email** (optional): Their email address (useful for sending reports)
   - **Phone** (optional): Their phone number
4. Click **"Add Flatmate"**

**Important**: Flatmates are added to your currently selected Split Space. Make sure you have the right Split Space selected!

### Editing a Flatmate

- Click the **Edit** icon (pencil) on any flatmate card
- Update their information and save

### Deleting a Flatmate

- Click the **Delete** icon (trash) on a flatmate card
- Confirm the deletion

**Note**: If a flatmate has expenses associated with them, you may need to handle those expenses first.

## Tracking Expenses

The **Expenses** page is where you record all shared expenses and split them among your flatmates.

### Adding an Expense

1. Go to the **Expenses** page
2. Click **"Add Expense"** button
3. Fill in the expense details:

   - **Title**: What the expense is for (e.g., "Grocery Shopping", "Uber Ride")
   - **Amount**: The total cost (e.g., 150.00)
   - **Date**: When the expense occurred
   - **Paid By**: Who paid for this expense (select from your flatmates)
   - **Split Between**: Select all the people who should share this cost
     - Check the boxes next to each flatmate's name
     - The amount will be automatically divided equally among selected people

4. Click **"Add Expense"**

### How Expense Splitting Works

- If an expense is **$100** and split between **4 people**, each person owes **$25**
- The person who paid gets credited for the full amount
- The system automatically calculates who owes what to whom

### Editing an Expense

- Click the **Edit** icon on any expense card
- Modify the details and save

### Deleting an Expense

- Click the **Delete** icon on an expense card
- Confirm the deletion

## Viewing Reports

The **Reports** page provides comprehensive insights into your expenses, balances, and settlement instructions.

### Understanding the Reports Page

#### Date Range Selection

- Select a **start date** and **end date** to filter expenses
- By default, it shows expenses from the beginning of the current month to today
- All calculations and reports will be based on this date range

#### Balance Summary

This table shows:

- **Total Paid**: How much each person has paid
- **Total Owed**: How much each person owes (their share of expenses)
- **Net Balance**: The difference (positive = they're owed money, negative = they owe money)
- **Status**:
  - "Owes Money" = They should receive money
  - "Needs Money" = They need to pay money
  - "Settled" = They're all square

#### Settlement Instructions

This section shows exactly who needs to pay whom and how much:

- Example: "Alice → Bob: ₹250.00" means Alice should pay Bob ₹250

The system calculates the minimum number of transactions needed to settle all balances.

### Exporting Reports

#### Copy to Clipboard

1. **Copy Settlement Summary**: Copies a text summary of who owes what
2. **Copy All Expense Splitting**: Copies a detailed breakdown of all expenses grouped by who paid

These are useful for sharing via messaging apps or email.

#### Download PDF Reports

1. **All Expenses PDF**:

   - Detailed list of all expenses in the date range
   - Shows date, description, who paid, who it was split with, and amounts
   - Perfect for record-keeping

2. **Balance Summary PDF**:
   - Complete settlement report
   - Includes balance summary, settlement instructions, and user-wise transaction details
   - Professional format suitable for sharing

#### Sending Reports via Email

3. Choose email type:
   - **Comprehensive Report**: Same report sent to everyone
   - **Individual Reports**: Personalized summary for each person
4. Click **"Send Email"**

## Tips & Best Practices

### Organizing Your Expenses

1. **Use Split Spaces Wisely**:

   - Keep different contexts separate (home vs. vacation)
   - Don't create too many spaces - it can get confusing

2. **Be Consistent with Names**:

   - Use consistent names for flatmates across all Split Spaces
   - Add email addresses for easy report sharing

3. **Regular Updates**:
   - Add expenses as soon as they occur
   - Review balances regularly to avoid large settlements

### Managing Balances

1. **Settle Regularly**:

   - Don't let balances accumulate too much
   - Use the Reports page to see when settlements are needed

2. **Verify Before Settling**:

   - Check the Balance Summary before making payments
   - Use the Settlement Instructions for accurate amounts

3. **Keep Records**:
   - Download PDF reports for your records
   - They're useful for tax purposes or future reference

### Best Practices for Groups

1. **Clear Communication**:

   - Share reports with all flatmates regularly
   - Use email reports to keep everyone informed

2. **Fair Splitting**:

   - Make sure everyone agrees on how expenses are split
   - Some expenses might not need to be split equally (e.g., personal items)

3. **Default Split Space**:
   - Use your "Default" space for regular, ongoing expenses
   - Create new spaces for special occasions or separate groups

### Troubleshooting

**Can't delete a Split Space?**

- Make sure it's not named "Default" (this cannot be deleted)
- Remove all flatmates and expenses first

**Expense amounts seem wrong?**

- Check that you've selected the correct people in "Split Between"
- Verify the date range in Reports matches when expenses were added

**Can't see expenses?**

- Make sure you have a Split Space selected
- Check that you're looking at the correct date range
